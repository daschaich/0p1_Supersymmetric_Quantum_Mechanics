# Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics with Qiskit
The 0+1 supersymmetric quantum mechanics spontaneous supersymmetry breaking is investigated by calculating the ground state energy of the system (i.e zero preserved, non-zero breaking.), for three different superpontetials:

- Harmonic Oscillator
- Double Well
- Anharmonic Oscillator

The groud state energy calculation is performed by using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver [`(VQE)`](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5213) algorithm implemented in [`QISKIT`](https://www.qiskit.org). For a general introductory course on the VQE please have a look here (https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/variational-algorithm-design). For a comprehensive introduction to designing a VQE in QISKIT, please visit the IBM [Variational Algorithm Design] (https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/variational-algorithm-design).



Results from quantum simulations, both with and without shot noise, are presented in the [`proceeding`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15083). If you find this work useful, please refer to [How to cite](#How_to_cite).
