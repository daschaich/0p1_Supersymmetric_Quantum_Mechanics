# Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics with Qiskit
The 0+1 supersymmetric quantum mechanics spontaneous supersymmetry breaking is investigated using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm implemented in [`QISKIT`](https://www.qiskit.org).

The study investigates whether supersymmetry is preserved or broken by calculating the ground state energy of the system (i.e zero preserved, non-zero breaking.), for three different superpontetials:

- Harmonic Oscillator
- Double Well
- Anharmonic Oscillator

Results from quantum simulations, both with and without shot noise, are presented in the [`proceeding`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15083). If you find this work useful, please refer to [How to cite](#How_to_cite).
